# EAT WHAT
Simple "EAT-WHAT" application made serveral years before. It helps you choose the your lunch menu with your co-workers by shaking your device.

## WTF is this
When I was worked previous job, there were so many good food shops so it was really hard to which one to go.
This helped to decide where to go, maybe...?

## How to run
You need mobile device. Somehow, make this accessible with your mobile device and run.
When the website coming up, shake your device!

## IT DOESN'T WORK
Maybe it doesn't work, it's little old script. Don't worry, I'll be check soon and fix!

## I saw the image somewhere...
Yes, I didn't wrote the code for drawing roulette on the canvas!

It's based on this, made by [barney-parker](https://codepen.io/barney-parker/): https://codepen.io/barney-parker/pen/OPyYqy

All I did is just shrink this to mobile platform and add shake functionality.

So I will not release this with free software license. I can't sure you can use this in your commercial project, so just look the source code to see how it works.
